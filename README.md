Hello, am documenting my JS learning journey as I want to gain a mastery in it for future projects in mind.
I know not everyday I'll be consistent but one thing for sure I wont stop.
I'll also be putting up some projects that I will be working on as a result of what ive learnt and explored
Done with phase one of learning some basics of Js
